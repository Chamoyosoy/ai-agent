# AI Code Assistant
This description was created by the program itself, is a tests of the program, and this add a explanation of the example files xd, but works ok with simple tasks like a documentation.
i dont know enough english so the comments can have a lot of orthography and grammatical erros, maybe i should ask to this program to add comments itself xd.  Human out. 

This project is an AI code assistant that leverages the Gemini API to generate code based on user prompts. It can also call functions to perform specific tasks within the codebase.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `gogle-genai` library (version 1.12.1)
- `python-dotenv` library (version 1.1.0)
- A Gemini API key (set as the environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
    -   On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    -   On macOS and Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4.  Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Configuration

-   Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable with your Gemini API key. You can store this in a `.env` file in the project root.
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

## Usage

```
python main.py "your prompt here" [--verbose]
```

Example:

```
python main.py "How do I build a calculator app?"
```

-   `your prompt here`: The prompt for the AI code assistant.
-   `--verbose`: Optional flag to print the user prompt and metadata from the response.

## Project Structure

-   `main.py`: The main entry point of the application.
-   `config.py`: Configuration file with settings like `MAX_CHARS`, `WORKING_DIR`, and `MAX_ITERS`.
-   `prompts.py`: Contains the system prompt used to instruct the AI model.
-   `call_function.py`: Handles calling functions based on the AI model's requests.
-   `calculator/`: A directory containing example code for a calculator application (likely generated by the assistant).
-   `tests.py`: Contains tests for the application.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.

## Available Functions

The AI code assistant can call the following functions:

-   `get_files_info`: Lists files and directories in a specified directory.
-   `get_file_content`: Reads the content of a specified file.
-   `write_file`: Writes content to a file.
-   `run_python_file`: Executes a Python file.

## Notes

-   The `MAX_ITERS` config variable in `config.py` limits the number of iterations to prevent infinite loops.
-   The project uses the `dotenv` library to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
